Iâ€™m a 3rd year student at Boston College, studying computer science <> math and a few classes in neuroscience.

I'm currently exploring and looking for a company to get involved in and spend all my time on ðŸ¦¤.

I have a lot of fun using my hands to build stuff. I've made rugs, random 3dprinted objects, etc. u name it. I do a lot of this as a part of the [hatchery team](https://design-innovation.bc.edu/makerspaces/).

Recently I've been creating a Neovim plugin @ [Pieces.](https://pieces.app/)

Previously I did product/eng @ [Diem.](https://www.askdiem.com/)

I also did a couple things at [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/), [Boston Public Health Commission](https://www.boston.gov/government/cabinets/boston-public-health-commission), [Coforge](https://www.coforge.com/), and [Heart IO](https://www.heartio.ai/).
